# MPASS
Messaging Platform As A Service(An Industry Project for GoSchool 2021).

MPASS(Messaging Platform As A Service) is a http-based API microservice providing messaging services. MPASS’s mission is to provide a centralised messaging service. It’s charter is to provide a new communications platform to centralise all outbound communications to customers. The goal is to
have a single platform that the Client’s developers can use to programmatically send messages from their service to customers.

From MPASS itself the parent project, the logging module(MyLog) was carved out as a separate sub-project to innovatively explore the provision of a distributed logging service, instead of the usual file logging. This has future scope to be a 'mini-Splunk'.

The 2 reports covers the technical aspect of the SDLC, as well as some subjective observations and opinions for learning purposes.
